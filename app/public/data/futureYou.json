In this highly technical role, you need to be both a good problem solver and communicator. ",

They study the origin and function of medicines and research the affect of natural and man-made drugs on living organisms. For example, if you took an antibiotic, what affect would it have on your cells, body tissue, organs and body as a whole? How exactly do the chemicals kill the bug? Is there another way to apply the chemicals so they're more effective? A love of chemistry and biology is essential. A love of lab coats is optional. ",
